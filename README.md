# Summary

This project, "scrape-by-selenium", is a web scraping tool built using Selenium WebDriver. It allows users to scrape content from web pages by providing a URL as a command line argument. The tool initializes a Chrome browser instance, navigates to the specified URL, and retrieves the page source along with all the hyperlinks present on the page. The scraped data is then logged to the console for further analysis or processing.
